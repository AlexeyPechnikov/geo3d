## Geo3D (Geology 3D): Powerful and Accessible 3D Inversion

The software leverages dipole physics for 3D inversion, identifying geological structures by analyzing magnetic or gravitational dipoles and their depth-related circular patterns through Radon edge detection and Gaussian filtering for unique, stable numerical solutions. This approach, grounded in physics and mathematics, aids geologists in interpreting data from various sources to locate subsurface features. It's fast, robust, and applies visual morphometric analysis effectively.

## About Geo3D

The Python library Geo3D offers an effective method for modeling 3D geological structures using the potential inversion techniques. Geo3D not only performs the inversion but also provides functions to download source datasets from the open Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and produce 3D output in VTK files. The output can then be post-processed in open-source software like ParaView and Blender to create high-quality, dynamic 3D geological models suitable for films, and for viewing in Virtual and Augmented Reality (AR/VR) on modern iOS and Android smartphones, as well as on specialized headsets.

This open-source library provides three output statistics. I also sell commercial software that detects vertical and horizontal density anomalies for gas and oil investigations and fractalities for mineral exploration tasks. Nevertheless, the open-source version is sufficient for numerous projects.
