## GeoMed3D (Geologic Medium 3D) â€“ 3D Density Inversion Accessible for Everyone

The Python library GeoMed3D provides an effective way of modeling 3D geological structures using potential inversion techniques. This fast and robust technology is based on the mathematical Radon transform, also known as focal statistics in GIS sciences. To achieve numerical calculation stability, the Gaussian transform should be applied. By combining these transforms, we have the ability to restore density and anomaly models using both gravity and magnetic data, as well as digital elevation model and satellite radar and optical images, including spatial harmonics of the gravity and magnetic fields. The theoretical basis and practical proof are shared below. GeoMed3D not only performs the inversion but also has functions to download source datasets from the open Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and produce 3D output VTK files. The output can be post-processed in open-source ParaView and Blender software to create high-quality dynamic 3D geological models for films, and for viewing them in Virtual and Augmented Reality (AR/VR) on modern iOS and Android smartphones, as well as in specialized headsets.

Pay attention, only the density output is available because I have been selling commercial software for 15 years that also detects density anomalies and fractalities for mineral exploration tasks. Nevertheless, the open version is sufficient for numerous projects, and I have a synthetic model to confirm the inversion technique. Also, it has been applied to reproduce known results from NASA and other peer-reviewed articles.
